        <h2>Five facts about Mario you didn't know</h2>

      <div>
        <h3>Mario wasn’t always called Mario</h3>
        <img src="images/MarioNSMBUDeluxe.png" alt="Mario" />
        <p>
          <span class="first-letter">I</span>n the early stages of developing
          Mario’s character Nintendo originally gave him the name Jumpman.
          Creator Shigeru Miyamoto also toyed with the idea of calling him Mr
          Video before finally deciding to name him Mario after the landlord of
          their American Nintendo warehouse.

        <h3>Mario was the bad guy</h3>
        <img src="images/Mental-Floss.png" alt="Donkey Kong" />
        <p>
          <span class="first-letter">M</span>ario, under his original name
          Jumpman, made his first appearance as a side character in the cult
          classic Donkey Kong game created by Nintendo in 1981. In this game,
          Mario mistreated his pet Donkey Kong causing the ape to kidnap his
          girlfriend.

        <h3>Not just your average plumber</h3>
        <img src="images/nanobuds-705x1024.png" alt="Doctor Mario" />
        <p>
          <span class="first-letter">W</span>e all know Mario and Luigi as
          Mushroom Kingdoms favourite plumbers, however, Mario has had a few
          career changes in his time. In Donkey Kong Mario is a carpenter, but
          in other games, he is a medical physician, an archaeologist, champion
          kart racer, golfing aficionado and even the tycoon of a successful toy
          manufacturing company.

        <h3>
          Goombas were the last enemies added to the game Super Mario Bros
        </h3>
        <img src="images/Goomba_-_MarioPartyStarRush.webp" alt="Goomba" />
        <p>
          <span class="first-letter">Y</span>up, the first enemy you encounter
          in Super Mario Bros. was actually one of the last things added to the
          game. At the last moment Miyamoto decided the game needed an easy
          enemy that could be killed with a single hit, but cartridge space was
          so limited at that point that they needed to be as simple as possible,
          so they basically created a little ball with eyes with a two-frame
          walking animation. By the by, Goombas are called Kuribo in Japan,
          which basically translates to “chestnut people”, so my friend that
          always called them raisins was wrong. I’m totally forwarding this to
          him.

        <h3>"Yoshi" isn't Yoshi's full name</h3>
        <img src="images/YoshiMP8.webp" alt="Yoshi" />
        <p>
          <span class="first-letter">T</span>here are a lot of things we just
          sort of accept about Yoshi. For one, the fact that he hatches
          fully-formed out of the egg, complete with a built-in saddle. That,
          and we just sort of pretend every dinosaur that comes out of a
          polka-dotted egg is named "Yoshi," even if that was the name of the
          guy that got dumped in a bottomless pit two levels back. We can ignore
          these existential questions because hey, it's a video game. No one was
          really asking what Yoshi's full name was, but apparently someone at
          Nintendo thought that was a more important issue to address than a
          dinosaur being born with shoes. An internal character guide unearthed
          by Blake Harris revealed something startling about Yoshi. So, Yoshi's
          full name is... "T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas." The T. is left ambiguous,
          though we could guess it stands for "Transportation" or
          "Tyrannosaurus" or "Travis."
